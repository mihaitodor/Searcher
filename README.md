# Searcher
Visual Studio code searcher extension

This is a Proof of Concept Visual Studio 2017 extension with some really hackish code written super-late at night.

## Purpose
Allows users to leverage command line tools such as [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to search through files directly from Visual Studio.
